                <li>Final interpretation of each category meaning is up to the judges, but as general guidelines: <dl> <dt>Creativity</dt><dd>This category assigns points for unexpectedness, eccentricity, fun. This is a broad category that may apply to the project, its code, the team, etc.</dd> <dt>Usefulness</dt><dd>How useful the project will be for its target users. Does it solve an existing problem? Does it significantly reduce work time for its users?</dd> <dt>Innovation</dt><dd>How groundbreaking the project is. The more unique and unprecedented the idea behind the project, the better. Also applies to projects developed in a unique way.</dd> <dt>Correctness</dt><dd>The less bugs, the better. This category values working products over complete ones.</dd> <dt>Maintainability</dt><dd>How easy will be for future developers to keep contributing to this project after SpawnFest is over.</dd> <dt>Completion</dt><dd>Is the project functional? Did the team get to a point where there is something to show, even if there are a few bugs here and there?</dd> </dl> </li>
